3. Key Visual Insights
Bar Plot of Views per Category
The bar plot provides a comparison of the total views across different categories. The highest-viewed categories, such as Gaming, Entertainment, and Music, are clearly outperforming others. This indicates that these categories dominate in terms of attracting viewer attention, making them critical for content creators to focus on if aiming for a broad audience.
Heatmap of Correlations
The heatmap reveals the relationships between various metrics. Strong positive correlations are observed between:
•	Views and Likes
•	Views and Subscribers
This suggests that channels with high views are more likely to receive higher likes and subscribers, reinforcing the importance of content reach. Conversely, there are weaker correlations between comments and income, indicating that engagement doesn’t necessarily lead to higher revenue.
Density Chart of Total Income
The density chart of total income shows a skewed distribution. A significant portion of channels generates relatively lower income, while a few high-performing outliers account for a large proportion of total income. This indicates that monetization opportunities are highly concentrated among a small number of channels, pointing to a “winner-takes-all” dynamic.
